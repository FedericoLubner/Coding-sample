    "# 3. Considerations and insights\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**A) Absolute difference in SME share**\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional tenders see on average 69.2% of bids coming from SMEs, whereas innovative tenders only see 49.9%.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s a raw drop of about 19.3 percentage points—a substantial gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "**B) Relative comparison**\n",
    "\n",
    "RR= 0.4986/0.69198 ≈ 0.72\n",
    "\n",
    "SMEs are bidding to innovative tenders at only about 72% of the rate they bid to traditional ones (i.e. a 28% relative reduction).\n",
    "\n",
    "**C) Odds Ratio**\n",
    "\n",
    "If we convert each proportion into odds:\n",
    "\n",
    "**ODDSinnov** = 0.4986/(1 − 0.4986)≈ **0.994**\n",
    "\n",
    "**ODDStrad** = 0.69198/(1 − 0.69198) ≈ **2.246**\n",
    "\n",
    "Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "**OR= 0.994/2.246 ≈ 0.44**\n",
    "\n",
    "So the odds that a given bid is from an SME are roughly 56 % lower in innovative tenders than in traditional ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample sizes and statistical power**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can notice that in the datasets there are ~1.85 million traditional awards vs. just ~2 200 innovative awards.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sheer imbalance means that the Z-test was overwhelmingly powered (hence Z≈–31.2, p≪0.001), but the effect size (the ~0.20 difference in proportions) is what’s really interesting. Indeed, Effect Size (Absolute Difference in Proportions)\n",
    "The SME‐participation rate in traditional tenders is 0.6919 (69.19 %), whereas in innovative tenders it is 0.4986 (49.86 %). The absolute difference of 19.33%, indicates that traditional procedures attract nearly one‐fifth more SME bids than innovation procurement call for tenders. Such a large gap justifies targeted measures (e.g., SME incubation schemes, simplified tender documents, dedicated innovation calls) to boost SME involvement in innovation‐focused contracts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Insights**\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings suggest that current innovation‐procurement policies are not effectively encouraging SME participation. Possible discouraging factors include:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Barrier to Entry**\n",
    "Innovation procedures impose a series of hurdles that disproportionately impact SMEs, limiting their ability to compete on equal footing with larger organizations:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical and Administrative Complexity**\n",
    "Innovation partnerships and competitive dialogues typically require detailed proposals outlining novel technical solutions, project roadmaps, risk mitigation plans, and intellectual property management strategies. Preparing these documents demands specialized expertise—often requiring legal, financial, and technical advisors—that many SMEs lack in-house. The sheer volume and sophistication of paperwork can discourage smaller firms with lean project teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Resource and Capacity Requirements**\n",
    "These tenders often involve multi-phase procurement processes (e.g., preliminary concept validation, prototyping, final development) and may span several years. SMEs must allocate staff time, invest in R&D, and secure working capital up front, without guaranteed award. Larger companies, by contrast, can amortize these costs across broader portfolios or self-finance development phases, making high-resource calls less risky for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Financial Guarantees and Bonding**\n",
    "Many high-value innovation contracts demand performance guarantees, bid bonds, or parent-company guarantees that tie up SMEs’ limited capital or require external collateral. Smaller enterprises frequently struggle to meet bank guarantee thresholds or negotiate favorable bonding terms, especially when cash-flow is already committed to core operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Consortium Expectations**\n",
    "Innovation tenders often favor or even mandate consortium bids, bringing together multiple stakeholders (e.g., research institutes, large integrators, technology partners). While consortiums can distribute costs and risks, forming and managing a network of partners—defining roles, aligning objectives, negotiating IP sharing—requires significant legal and managerial bandwidth. SMEs may lack both the network connections and project management resources to lead or even join such consortia effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Risk Perception and Market Reputation**\n",
    "Innovation contracts carry higher uncertainty around deliverables, timelines, and market outcomes. Public buyers may see large, established firms as safer bets for cutting-edge projects, reinforcing a cycle where SMEs are bypassed even if they possess specialized niche expertise. This perception gap can deter SMEs from bidding, fearing reputational damage from failed high-stakes procurements."
